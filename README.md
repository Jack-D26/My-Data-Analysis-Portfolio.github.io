### 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m **Joaquín Romero**, a data analyst with a degree in **International Business** and a passion for **AI, business intelligence, and workflow automation**.  
My sweet spot is bridging business problems with analytical solutions: cleaning raw data, uncovering patterns, and turning insights into actions that move the bottom line. I enjoy building end-to-end analytics pipelines— from Python notebooks to BI dashboards— and I’m continuously sharpening my skills in cloud, prompt-engineering, and low-code automation tools.

### 📂 Featured Projects

**1. Customer Churn & Segmentation – Model Fitness**  
_Cluster analysis + early-life churn focus_  
I explored churn behaviour for a gym chain, engineered engagement features, and used **K-Means** to segment members into four actionable personas. Findings showed that short-term contracts and low visit frequency drove a 27 % churn rate, leading to onboarding and retention recommendations that target the first 90 days.

**2. Hypothesis Prioritisation & A/B-Test – Retail Platform**  
_ICE / RICE scoring + statistical test_  
Mapped eleven growth ideas, ranked them with **ICE and RICE**, then evaluated a live checkout A/B test. Cumulative-revenue curves and Mann-Whitney tests revealed that uplift was driven by a handful of high-ticket orders—guiding the team to extend the test, verify anomalies, and invest only in high-ROI hypotheses.

**3. Marketing-ROI & Customer-Journey – Showz Ticket Marketplace**  
_Cohort LTV + ROMI dashboard_  
Merged two years of web logs, orders, and ad spend to analyse traffic, funnel timing, and **CAC versus LTV** by channel. Cohort revenue flattened after month 4, and only one acquisition channel produced a positive ROMI. The study recommended scaling that channel, cutting four loss-making ones, and improving the mobile checkout to capture untapped demand.
